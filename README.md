This is a simple Java-based console game where one **Guesser** and **three Players participate**.
How does the game work?
The Guesser secretly picks a number.
Each Player then tries to guess that number.
The Umpire collects all the guesses and compares them.
The game announces who guessed correctly:
If one or more players guess the correct number, they win.
If no one guesses correctly, all players lose.

Concepts that have been used are:

Classes and Objects,
Scanner for input,
Conditional statements (if-else),
Boolean flags for comparison
